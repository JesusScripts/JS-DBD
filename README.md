# JS-DBD

### Hello! This project is for the game **Dead by Daylight**. I worked on it for about 2 weeks, and it was fun, but I'm not really interested in the game anymore. So I'd like to pass this project along. It's a simple project using **imgui**. The code is not mine, I took it from a leaked Fortnite repository, but **rat** is not included.

What you need to do:
1. In the **driver.hpp** file, replace the code with your own driver.
